## Gene identities among SARS-related coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants
This plot shows the percent **nucleotide** identities between different coronaviruses.

Use the dropdown menu to select the gene for which we show percent identities.
There is also an option to select the full genome and the full genome without the 5' and 3' UTRs (which are sometimes poorly sequenced).

Use the dropdown menu to select which virus we highlight percent identities relative to: that virus is shown first and comparisons with it are outlined in black.

Use the radio box to select with gaps are counted as mismatches or ignored when computing percent identities.

You can mouse over points in the heat map to get details.

See [https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_identities](https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_identities) for the computer code used to compute the identities and methodological details.
